## MAJOR ERROR ISSUE!!!!!!
- I was able to render the pages a few hours ago until now. I pulled two all nighters to try and get this done. I don't know what happend but it seems to be an issue with the **CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'** that is causing this and I tried for hours to fix the issue but I'm afraid I'm going to make it worse. I will just submit the project as is because all the code is there but I understand that there is no way of grading this properly and I don't want to miss the deadline which is in 5 hours. The issue I'm getting is as follows:

## My apologies 
The second half of this course has been difficult for me. I need more time with object-oriented programming to grasp a lot of the concepts. Other issues outside the course have played a role but that's no excuse. This has truly been a difficult to say the least.
